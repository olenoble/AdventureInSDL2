# AdventureInSDL2
First attempt at creating something with PySDL2

To install PySDL2:
* run "pip install pysdl2"
* download DLLs from http://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php and https://pysdl2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
* or from https://pypi.org/project/pysdl2-dll/  ))/ "pip install pysdl2-dll"
* save DLL in folder and set PATH in user env:
    * PYSDL2_DLL_PATH = .....
    * Note that sometimes (often ?) Pycharm is dumb AF, and the path need to be added in the script run config
